Hi there! I'm Yg, a passionate Full Stack developer based in Yunnan, China. Currently studying at YNU, I enjoy building creative DIY projects, tinkering with embedded systems, and exploring front-end and AI technologies. I regularly record my learning journey, read widely, and love experimenting with data and runners.

My technical toolbox spans across Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C/C++, GitHub, Raspberry Pi, Docker, PS, and more. Whether it's launching websites, designing records, or automating tasks, I thrive on combining knowledge and curiosity to make things work.

I believe that **the only way to do great is to love what you do**. Thanks for visiting my space—hope you find something inspiring!
